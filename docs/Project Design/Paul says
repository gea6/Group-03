We are using HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) for the website. The way this works is you send a request to a server asking for a resource; URL (Uniform resource locator).  A resource means is that we are asking for a web page to be formatted into e.g. .html,.php,pdf, mp3/4, image etc.
When you send a request, you type the URL into your address bar e.g. www.bbc.co.uk or www.google.com. then once you press enter your browser generates a HTTP request and sends it to the URL.

Once the server recives that request it then responds with the (html/php/mp3/etc.) file you asked for by delivering it to your browser. Your chrome/firefox rendering engine then looks at the code and displays all the links/pictures/text you requested.

A TaskerCLI works by transmitting data packets (TCP Packets) from the person who has TaskerCLI to the MySQLdb (TaskerSr).
