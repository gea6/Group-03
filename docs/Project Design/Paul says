well we are using http (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) for the website. the way it works is you send a request to a server asking for a resource (URL (Uniform resource locator)) all resource means is a web page (.html or .php or some other file mp3 or image)
the way you send a request is just type the URL into your address bar EG www.bbc.co.uk or www.google.com. then once you press enter your browser generates a HTTP request and sends it to the URL
a request in image form looks like this

then once the server recives that request it then responds with the (html/php/mp3) file you asked for by delivering it to your browser, which then chrome/firefox rendering engine (The part of teh web browser that is design to read html/javscript) looks at the codes and displays all the links/pictures/text in the way it was intended(ish)

TaskerCLI works by transmitting data packets (TCP Packets) from the person who has TaskerCLI to the MySQL db (TaskerSrv)
