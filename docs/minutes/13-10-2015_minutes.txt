6. Test Procedure Standards 每 SE.QA.06.
-	Module testing- Java Class with each class developed should have Junit test class.  Write this before designing and writing code (Programmer responsible) Don＊t need test plans/specification
-	System testing- Must be tested by a person who isn＊t involved in the design or programming the modules. Need plans/specification
-	Acceptance testing - involves testing the whole system following the set procedures by the client. When pass the tests and client likes it they will accept the product. This testing is carried out by the client with all group members around them.
-	Module testing left to coder. Java code take the form of Junit that tests all behaviour of the class. Written before coding is done. Other languages used, equivalent unit testing procedures should be defined. 
-	System testing done by writing a System Testing Specification during the design phase (covers major functionality). If system comprises more than 1 application, best to test each application independently to ensure that no errors are hidden anywhere. Test report will be needed to document any implementations that worked incorrectly.
-	Test Specification must cross reference appropriate section of the Requirements Specification for each feature tested. Also include an introduction/ reference section.
-	Must be very clear documentation including the table.
-	Test results must be maintained in a Test Report Folder. 2 sections:- Module Test and System Test. 
-	Test reports must be stored electronically in Version Control Repository.
-	Once coding complete the test should run and results be submitted with final report as a Test Report.
-	All items comprising a system to be tested are frozen into an identified configuration (tagged under name/number) Must use git tag. 
-	System Level Tests must be conducted periodically. 
-	A Test Form should be completed each time system tests are conducted. Results stored in Version Controlled Repository.
